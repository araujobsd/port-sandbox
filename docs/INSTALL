1) First of all, install all dependencies.
root# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql50-server/ ; make install clean
root# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/py-stdiff ;  make install clean
root# cd /usr/ports/www/py-cherrypy ; make install clean
root# cd /usr/ports/devel/py-cheetah ; make install clean
root# cd /usr/ports/databases/py-MySQLdb ; make install clean

Note: The MySQL server can be another version, isn't necessary to be exactly the 5.0.

2) Create a database called as portsandbox without password.
root# mysqladmin create portsandbox
root# mysql portsandbox < sql/portsandbox.sql
root# mysqlshow portsandbox

3) Create a JAIL environment.
root# cd scripts/jail/
root# python jail.py create FreeBSD-8 RELENG_8

4) Run the webserver.
root# cd webserver ; python webserver.py

5) Access the WebUI.
http://127.0.0.1:8080/

NOTE: Port-Sandbox is still using the default path of ports and also using the same default path of /var/db, with some ports you may find some problems or errors to build inside port-sandbox. Also the port-sandbox isn't done yet, it is the first BETA and it is still in constantly development.

Another important thing is, everything that you try to build inside port-sandbox will be done only inside port-sandbox, nothing will be executed directly in your production system. Although the port-sandbox build every port inside a jail, we can't be responsible for any damage into your system, or by a wrong install or even a problem on port-sandbox.
